TODO LIST


IMPLEMENT FLOW

1. user opens app, has to do 3 things
- import and locate their Delta.sqlite
- login to their dropbox, and locate the Delta folder (or we can locate for them)
- locate the local saves folder to be synced
once we have all these, we will put in config which will be loaded up and read everytime so these steps are skipped


2. implement syncing 
- check the timestamps for each save against each other,
- for each discovery, put into a queue to execute (2 for up and down maybe?)
- make a conversion function, that automatically renames the files as they go up and down based on Delta's headers

TODO: Dropbox header path isn't being sent to the upload item, causing a NONE type error for the path.
